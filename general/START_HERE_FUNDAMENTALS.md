## 💡 LEARNING TIPS

### **DO:**
✅ Code EVERY example yourself
✅ Modify examples to test understanding
✅ Read multiple solutions for each problem
✅ Time yourself on practice problems
✅ Explain solutions out loud
✅ Create your own problems
✅ Review weak areas

### **DON'T:**
❌ Just read without coding
❌ Memorize (understand instead)
❌ Skip edge cases
❌ Use only one approach
❌ Rush through easy problems
❌ Get stuck without checking solution
❌ Avoid hard problems

---

## 🔥 COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### **Lists**
- ❌ Modifying while iterating
- ❌ Confusing shallow vs deep copy
- ✅ Use .copy() carefully with nested lists

### **Dictionaries**
- ❌ Accessing non-existent keys directly
- ❌ Forgetting to use .get()
- ✅ Always use .get(key, default)

### **Sets**
- ❌ Trying to add unhashable objects (lists)
- ❌ Expecting ordered results
- ✅ Remember sets are unordered!

### **Lambda**
- ❌ Making lambda too complex
- ❌ Forgetting parentheses
- ✅ Use functions for complex logic

### **Comprehensions**
- ❌ Wrong variable names
- ❌ Confusing iteration order
- ✅ Test nested comprehensions carefully
